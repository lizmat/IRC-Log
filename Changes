Revision history for IRC-Log

{{$NEXT}}
    - Rename .this-target to .target-entry
    - Add methods .target-index, .entries-lt-target, .entries-le-target,
      .entries-ge-target, .entries-gt-target
    - The .entries and .problems methods now always return IterationBuffer

0.0.15  2021-11-10T00:52:31+01:00
    - Added .nick-names and .entries-of-nick methods
    - Added .clear method to reset an object for re-parsing
    - Pretty extensive refactor to save memory, probably a little
      bit at the expense of CPU.  Each message now consists of at
      least a "log" attribute, and a so-called hmon attribute (a
      32bit unsigned integer value containing hour, minute, ordinal
      and nick-index value).  Nick-names are now stored in a native
      str array (1-based).  Linking between messages is now done
      with the $entries and the associated $hmon values.  The %nicks
      hash is now gone: all there is now is a .entries-of-nick method
      that lazily produces the entries of the nick given.  This
      reduces the memory footprint significantly, as well as simplifies
      updating of any additional messages.  Consumers of the IRC::Log
      role can simplify their parsing logic, as they no longer need
      to keep track of position and other stuff
    - Added dependency on Array::Sorted::Util

      ordinal and pos

0.0.12  2021-10-24T13:28:40+02:00
    - Subtle change in semantics of .next/.prev.  Instead
      of returning Empty on end reached, they now return Nil
